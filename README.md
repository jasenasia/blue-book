Just another repo

https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. Let’s get started with GitHub!

GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on projects. You don’t have to worry about losing data on your hard drive or managing a project across multiple computers — sync from anywhere. Most importantly, GitHub is a collaborative and asynchronous workflow for building software better, together.

This guide walks you through the GitHub Essentials: Repositories, Branches, Commits, Issues and Pull Requests.

With these skills, you’ll go far. And with this hello-world repository you’ll have a place to store ideas (aka future repositories, like jlord/hello-world), resources or other general notes, even discuss things with others (like holman/feedback).

Install & Code Free Zone

We’re going to complete the tasks in this tutorial using GitHub.com, so you don’t have to know the command line or even install Git (which is the change-tracking software GitHub is built on). You don’t even need to know how to code. You will, however, need a GitHub account, so sign up if you don’t have one!

Me: This README is not completed. It's just an idea of what GitHub can do. Read the rest of the article online.
